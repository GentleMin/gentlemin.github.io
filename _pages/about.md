Grüezi! Welcome to the personal homepage of Jingtao Min.

Currently a doctoral student in Earth sciences at Departement Erdwissenschaften, ETH Zürich, I am mainly interested in numerical modelling, [inverse problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem) and [data assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_assimilation) in geophysics.

Since the beginning of my doctoral studies, I have taken a slight shift towards the underlying physics, and have been involved with studying the [magnetohydrodynamic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave) in the Earth fluid outer core.
With improved physical models, we might be able to place new constraints on the lower mantle conductivity structure or the magnetic field in the core, which ultimately affects the core-mantle, inner-core-outer-core coupling, and exchanges angular momentum between the different layers of the Earth.
Being a fickle person in pursuit of Earth sciences, I find my interest constantly shifting, and I'm open to new ideas.

I have been a major fantasy lover: *[Harry Potter](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)*, *[Lord of the Rings](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)*, and *[Chronicles of Narnia](https://narnia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_Wiki)*, for which I have been waiting forever for the next movie episode.
Since college, I have developed a keen interest in sitcoms. I like *[TBBT](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)*, *[Brooklyn 99](https://brooklyn99.fandom.com/wiki/Brooklyn_Nine-Nine_Wiki)*, and am also acquainted with New-York-based oldies such as *[Seinfeld](https://seinfeld.fandom.com/wiki/WikiSein)* and *Friends*; but on top of all those sitcoms, *[HIMYM](https://how-i-met-your-mother.fandom.com/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother_Wiki)* has always been my absolute favourite, and perhaps always will be, considering the scarcity of (good) sitcoms among the television programs nowadays.
I am also a long-running fan of Stephen King, and for similar reasons became fond of *[Stranger Things](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things_Wiki)* in recent years.

P.S. The profile picture on this page is not me, but my favourite icon, cropped from Pointillism painter Georges Seurat's *[Circus Sideshow](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437654)*.
