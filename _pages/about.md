Welcome to the personal homepage of Jingtao Min.

Currently a doctoral student in Earth sciences at Departement Erdwissenschaften, ETH Zürich, I am mainly interested in numerical modelling, [inverse problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem) and [data assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_assimilation) in geophysics.

Since the beginning of my doctoral studies, I have taken a slight shift towards the underlying physics, and have been involved with studying the reduced models of geodynamo and geomagnetic data assimilation.
Combining improved physical models with geomagnetic observations, we might be able to place new constraints on the dynamics of the Earth core and deep interior properties such as the electrical conductivity or the magnetic field.
These ultimately determines the core-mantle, inner-core-outer-core coupling, as well as the evolution of the geomagnetic field.
Being a fickle person in pursuit of Earth sciences, I find my interest constantly shifting, and I'm open to new ideas.

I have been a major fantasy lover: *[Harry Potter](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)*, *[Lord of the Rings](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)*, and *[Chronicles of Narnia](https://narnia.fandom.com/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia_Wiki)*, for which I have been waiting forever for the next movie episode.
Since college, I have developed a keen interest in sitcoms. I like *[TBBT](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)*, *[Brooklyn 99](https://brooklyn99.fandom.com/wiki/Brooklyn_Nine-Nine_Wiki)*, and am also acquainted with New-York-based oldies such as *[Seinfeld](https://seinfeld.fandom.com/wiki/WikiSein)* and *Friends*; but on top of all those sitcoms, *[HIMYM](https://how-i-met-your-mother.fandom.com/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother_Wiki)* has always been my absolute favourite, and perhaps always will be, considering the scarcity of (good) sitcoms among the television programs nowadays.
I am also a long-running fan of Stephen King, and for similar reasons became fond of *[Stranger Things](https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Stranger_Things_Wiki)* in recent years.

P.S. The profile picture on this page is not me, but my favourite icon, cropped from Pointillism painter Georges Seurat's *[Circus Sideshow](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/437654)*.
