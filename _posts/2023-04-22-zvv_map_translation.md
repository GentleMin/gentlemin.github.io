Now it is quite clear that although the GPT model has knowledge on the correct formulation of FDM, it failed to perform the task of correctly combining the terms together. This again seems to be part of the flaw of symbolic derivation and computation.
The code certainly is elegant, and might well pass for a real "wave equation" solver at first sight, just without the correct physics.
