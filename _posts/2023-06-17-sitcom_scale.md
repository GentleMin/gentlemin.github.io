I have watched my fair share of sitcoms - I mean for a person my age. For a person born in the eighties or earlier, I suppose it would be a lot easier to watch large amounts of sitcoms, as sitcoms used to be something that were aired on TV fairly regularly, thus well integrated into everyday life. Not anymore, no. These days people are no longer waiting in front of their TVs for their favourite show to start (do people still even talk about their favourite "TV shows"?). Even for people that still watch quite a lot TV series/movies, sitcoms is no longer a popular go-to genre these days.

How sitcoms gradually lost their popuarlity and faded into the "out-dated" background is a discussion for another day. One does notice, however, that throughout the years, some successful sitcoms have seen calls for reunion, sequels or rebranding; and some of these proposals have actually been realized. To name a few, *Friends: The Reunion* (2021), a reunion special of perhaps the most successful sitcom of all time, was produced 17 years after the last episode had been aired, not to mention the *Joey* show that followed directly. The prequel to *The Big Bang Theory*, *Young Sheldon* (2017), started even before the original show ended. And just last year, the streaming platform Hulu launched *How I Met Your Father* (2022), a rebranding of the show *How I Met Your Mother* which ended eight years ago.

Granted, not all these attempts for resurrecting the old sitcoms are successful. *How I Met Your Father*, for instance, seems to have already gained an ill name, one year after its launch. Nevertheless, these attempts at least show that there is certain nostalgia in the viewership of certain sitcoms that can be leveraged, or further exploited. In constrast, some equally (if not more) critically-acclaimed and popular sitcoms never seem to have received similar attention. For instance, no one seems to be willing to bring Mr. Bean back on the TV screen. There are several movies under the *Johnny English* franchise, which share quite some similarities with *Bean*, but do not count towards this. Nor does it seem in anyone's need to bring back *The IT Crowd*. Resurrecting *Bean* might be more feasible in the sense that the show simply intended to potrait a silly and clumsy man, and so these jokes do not really go out of date or require modern modification.

The willingness of the audience to see a spin-off of *Friends* instead of *Beans* seems to indicate there is difference in style between these shows that attracts their respective audience.
