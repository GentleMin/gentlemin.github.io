In the ~~celebrated and acclaimed~~ (I seem to be the only one celebrating and acclaiming) cartoon film [Hoodwinked!](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443536/?ref_=ext_shr_lnk) from 2005, one of the main characters, the Woodsman, drives a Schnitzel truck which serves "Schnitzel on a stick".

*To miss this dream will make me sick*  
*But for now I serve the Schnitzel stick!*  
Says the man who dreams of becoming part of a Yodelling group or an actor, but can only get the role of a Woodsman in the commercial, and has to serve Schnitzels on a stick for a living.

But what exactly is **a Schnitzel on a stick**? This idea is rejected by Tobi (and pretty much everyone in our research group). To them, Schnitzel on a stick is as much as a heresy as: pineapples on a pizza, ketchup on pasta, and (to very selected people) Nutella inside a croissant. To show that it is a thing, I managed to find a Schnitzel truck from Texas that actually serves Schnitzel on a stick:

Apparently, the Schnitzel on a stick has mostly the same topology as a regular Schnitzel (not meatballs or separated pieces of meat on a skewer), only with a wavy pattern and is pierced by a stick.
The same owner of the Schnitzel truck also provides the recipe for making your Schnitzel on a stick!

Now everyone can make their own Schnitzel on a stick at home!
